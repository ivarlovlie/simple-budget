# Simple Budget

## Developing

Use [bun](https://bun.sh/docs) to manage packages for, build and run the project.

Install `bun` with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`  (windows: `powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"`)

Run `bunx lefthook install` before your first commit.

We require all commits to pass checks ran by lefthook, if your commit is non-compliant, make it compliant.
